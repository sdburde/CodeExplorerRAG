(Sum of Squared Residuals / Total Sum of Squares)\n* The sum of squared residuals is the sum of the squared differences between the actual values and the predicted values.\n* The total sum of squares is the sum of the squared differences between the actual values and the mean of Y.\n\n### Important Facts\n\n* R\u00b2 can never be negative.\n* A high R\u00b2 value indicates a good fit of the model to the data.\n* Adding irrelevant features to a model can still increase the R\u00b2 value.\n\n### Actionable Insights\n\n* **Interpretation of R\u00b2**: R\u00b2 values can be interpreted as follows:\n + 0-0.3: Poor fit\n + 0.3-0.5: Fair fit\n + 0.5-0.7: Good fit\n + 0.7-0.9: Very good fit\n + 0.9-1: Excellent fit\n* **Feature Selection**: R\u00b2 can be used to select relevant features for a model. Features that do not contribute to an increase in R\u00b2 can be removed from the model.\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose we have a model that predicts the price of a house based on the number of bedrooms. The R\u00b2 value is 85%. If we add a feature that represents the location of the house, the R\u00b2 value may increase to 90%. However, if we add a feature that represents the gender of the homeowner, the R\u00b2 value may still increase to 91% even though the feature is not correlated with the price of the house.\n\n**Adjusted R-Square: A Comprehensive Guide**\n=====================================================\n\n**What is Adjusted R-Square?**\n-----------------------------\n\nAdjusted R-Square, also known as R-Square Adjusted, is a modified version of the R-Square value that takes into account the number of features or predictors in a model. It is used to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model is not overly complex.\n\n**Formula for Adjusted R-Square**\n--------------------------------\n\nThe formula for Adjusted R-Square is:\n\n1 - (1 - R\u00b2) * (N - 1) / (N - P - 1)\n\nWhere:\n\n* R\u00b2 is the R-Square value\n* N is the total number of samples\n* P is the number of features or predictors\n\n**How Adjusted R-Square Works**\n-------------------------------\n\nWhen the number of features or predictors (P) increases, the value of (N - P - 1) decreases. This means that the denominator in the formula becomes smaller, resulting in a larger value for the adjusted R-Square.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Overfitting**: When a model is too complex and fits the noise in the data rather than the underlying patterns.\n* **R-Square**: A measure of the goodness of fit of a model, ranging from 0 to 1.\n* **Adjusted R-Square**: A modified version of R-Square that takes into account the number of features or predictors.\n\n**Actionable Insights:**\n\n* Use Adjusted R-Square to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model is not overly complex.\n* Monitor the Adjusted R-Square value to ensure that it is not increasing excessively as the number of features or predictors increases.\n* Consider using regularization techniques, such as Lasso or Ridge regression, to reduce overfitting.\n\n**Important Facts:**\n\n* Adjusted R-Square is a more robust measure of model performance than R-Square.\n* Adjusted R-Square can help identify models that are overly complex and prone to overfitting.\n* Adjusted R-Square is a useful tool for model selection and evaluation.\n\n**Ridge and Lasso Regression**\n=============================\n\n**Key Concepts**\n---------------\n\n*   **R-Squared (R\u00b2)**: measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).\n*   **Adjusted R-Squared (R\u00b2_adj)**: adjusts R\u00b2 for the number of predictors in the model to avoid overfitting.\n*   **Ridge Regression**: a type of regression analysis that adds a penalty term to the cost function to prevent overfitting.\n*   **Lasso Regression**: a type of regression analysis that adds a penalty term to the cost function to prevent overfitting, with the added constraint that some coefficients may be set to zero.\n\n**Important Facts**\n------------------\n\n*   As the number of predictors (p) increases, the R\u00b2 value may decrease, even if the model is still a good fit.\n*   The adjusted R\u00b2 value is always less than or equal to the R\u00b2 value.\n*   Ridge and Lasso regression are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function.\n\n**Actionable Insights**\n----------------------\n\n*   Use adjusted R\u00b2 instead of R\u00b2 to evaluate the goodness of fit of a model, especially when the number of predictors is high.\n*   Use Ridge or Lasso regression when the number of predictors is high and the model is prone to overfitting.\n*   Regularly monitor the R\u00b2 and adjusted R\u00b2 values to ensure that the model is not overfitting.\n\n**Ridge and Lasso Regression Formulas**\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   **Ridge Regression Cost Function**: J(\u03b8) = (1/2m) \\* \u03a3(i=1 to m) (h\u03b8(x(i)) -

A larger value of lambda results in a stronger penalty and a more regularized model.\n* **Regularization**: Regularization is the process of adding a penalty term to the cost function to prevent overfitting.\n\n### How Ridge Regression Works\n\n* The algorithm starts with an initial guess for the coefficients (slopes) of the features.\n* It calculates the cost function for the current coefficients and adds a penalty term proportional to the magnitude of the coefficients.\n* The algorithm then updates the coefficients to minimize the cost function.\n* This process is repeated until convergence or a specified number of iterations.\n\n### Importance of Ridge Regression\n\n* Ridge regression helps to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function.\n* It results in a more generalized model that is less prone to overfitting.\n* The model is able to handle a wider range of data and is more robust to noise and outliers.\n\n### Key Insights\n\n* The value of lambda controls the strength of the penalty term and the level of regularization.\n* A larger value of lambda results in a more regularized model that is less prone to overfitting.\n* The number of iterations controls the number of times the algorithm updates the coefficients.\n* The iterations hyperparameter controls the trade-off between bias and variance.\n\n### Actionable Insights\n\n* Use ridge regression when you have a large number of features and want to prevent overfitting.\n* Experiment with different values of lambda to find the optimal level of regularization.\n* Monitor the R-squared or adjusted R-squared value to evaluate the performance of the model.\n* Use cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.\n\n### Key Formulas\n\n* Cost function: `J(\u03b8) = (1/2m) * \u2211(y_i - h_\u03b8(x_i))^2 + \u03bb/2 * \u2211(\u03b8_j^2)`\n* Penalty term: `\u03bb/2 * \u2211(\u03b8_j^2)`\n* Regularization term: `\u03bb * \u03b8_j^2`\n\n### Key Code Snippets\n\n* Python code for ridge regression: `from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge; model = Ridge(alpha=1.0); model.fit(X, y)`\n* Python code for cross-validation: `from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score; scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)`\n\n**Regularization Techniques in Machine Learning**\n=====================================================\n\n**Key Concepts**\n---------------\n\n### **Overfitting**\n\n* Occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely\n* Results in poor performance on unseen data\n* Regularization techniques help prevent overfitting\n\n### **Hyperparameters**\n\n* Parameters that are set before training a model\n* Examples: learning rate, regularization strength (Lambda)\n\n### **Convergence Algorithm**\n\n* Determines how many times the model's parameters are updated during training\n* Iterations refer to the number of times the model's parameters are updated\n\n### **Regularization Techniques**\n\n#### **L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression)**\n\n* Adds a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting\n* Formula: `y_hat = (X^T X + Lambda * I)^-1 X^T y`\n* Helps prevent overfitting by reducing the magnitude of the model's parameters\n\n#### **L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression)**\n\n* Adds a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting\n* Formula: `y_hat = (X^T X + Lambda * I)^-1 X^T y`\n* Helps prevent overfitting by setting some model parameters to zero\n* Also performs **feature selection** by identifying unimportant features\n\n**Actionable Insights**\n----------------------\n\n### **Feature Selection**\n\n* L1 regularization (Lasso Regression) helps identify unimportant features by setting their coefficients to zero\n* This can improve model performance by reducing the number of features and preventing overfitting\n\n### **Choosing Between L1 and L2 Regularization**\n\n* Use L1 regularization when:\n\t+ You have a large number of features and want to perform feature selection\n\t+ You want to reduce the number of features and improve model interpretability\n* Use L2 regularization when:\n\t+ You want to prevent overfitting without setting any model parameters to zero\n\t+ You want to reduce the magnitude of the model's parameters without affecting feature importance\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n-----------------\n\n* Regularization techniques help prevent overfitting and improve model performance\n* L1 and L2 regularization are two common techniques used to prevent overfitting\n* L1 regularization also performs feature selection by identifying unimportant features\n\n**Regularization Techniques in Linear Regression**\n=====================================================\n\n### Introduction\n\nRegularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting in linear regression models.

Two key metrics are Recall and Precision, which are used to measure the model's ability to correctly identify positive instances.\n\n### Recall\n\n* **Definition**: Recall is the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN).\n* **Formula**: Recall = TP / (TP + FN)\n* **Focus**: Recall focuses on the true positive rate, i.e., the proportion of actual positive instances that are correctly identified.\n* **Importance**: Recall is important in scenarios where missing a positive instance (false negative) has severe consequences, such as in medical diagnosis (e.g., cancer detection).\n\n### Precision\n\n* **Definition**: Precision is the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP).\n* **Formula**: Precision = TP / (TP + FP)\n* **Focus**: Precision focuses on the proportion of predicted positive instances that are actually true positives.\n* **Importance**: Precision is important in scenarios where false positives have significant consequences, such as in spam classification.\n\n### Choosing Between Recall and Precision\n\n* **Recall vs. Precision**: Recall is more important when the consequences of missing a positive instance are severe, while precision is more important when the consequences of false positives are significant.\n* **Example 1: Spam Classification**: In spam classification, precision is more important because false positives (i.e., legitimate emails being flagged as spam) can be annoying but not catastrophic. Therefore, the model should prioritize precision.\n* **Example 2: Cancer Detection**: In cancer detection, recall is more important because missing a positive instance (i.e., a person with cancer being misdiagnosed as healthy) can have severe consequences. Therefore, the model should prioritize recall.\n* **Example 3: Stock Market Prediction**: In stock market prediction, the model should prioritize precision because false positives (i.e., predicting a stock market crash when it doesn't happen) can lead to financial losses. However, the model should also consider the consequences of missing a positive instance (i.e., failing to predict a stock market crash when it happens).\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n* Recall and precision are two important performance metrics in machine learning.\n* Recall is more important when the consequences of missing a positive instance are severe, while precision is more important when the consequences of false positives are significant.\n* The choice between recall and precision depends on the specific problem statement and the consequences of missing or false positive instances.\n\n**F-Score (F-Beta) Study Notes**\n=====================================\n\n**Introduction**\n---------------\n\nThe F-Score, also known as F-Beta, is a measure of a model's accuracy that takes into account both precision and recall. It is used to evaluate the performance of a model in scenarios where both false positives and false negatives are important.\n\n**Key Concepts**\n----------------\n\n* **Precision**: The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.\n* **Recall**: The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.\n* **F-Score**: A measure of a model's accuracy that balances precision and recall.\n* **Beta**: A parameter that determines the weight given to precision and recall in the F-Score calculation.\n\n**F-Score Formula**\n-------------------\n\nThe F-Score formula is given by:\n\nF-Beta = (1 + beta^2) \\* Precision \\* Recall / (beta^2 \\* Precision + Recall)\n\n**Beta Values**\n----------------\n\n* **Beta = 1**: The F-Score becomes the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n* **Beta < 1**: Decreasing beta gives more importance to false positives than false negatives.\n* **Beta > 1**: Increasing beta gives more importance to false negatives than false positives.\n\n**F-Score Values**\n------------------\n\n* **F1-Score (Beta = 1)**: Balances precision and recall equally.\n* **F0.5-Score (Beta = 0.5)**: Gives more importance to precision than recall.\n* **F2-Score (Beta = 2)**: Gives more importance to recall than precision.\n\n**Actionable Insights**\n----------------------\n\n* Use F-Score to evaluate models in scenarios where both false positives and false negatives are important.\n* Adjust beta value to give more importance to precision or recall based on the problem statement.\n* Use F1-Score for balanced precision and recall, F0.5-Score for precision-focused evaluation, and F2-Score for recall-focused evaluation.\n\n**Practical Applications**\n-------------------------\n\n* Hyperparameter tuning for machine

This process is repeated multiple times.\n2. **Model Training**: Each subset of rows is used to train a separate model.\n3. **Model Output**: Each model produces an output for a given input.\n4. **Bootstrap Aggregator**: The outputs of multiple models are combined using majority voting.\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose we have a dataset with 10,000 records and we want to train four models (M1, M2, M3, M4) using bagging.\n\n* M1 is trained on a subset of 1,000 rows (D1)\n* M2 is trained on a subset of 1,000 rows (D2), which may contain some repeated rows from D1\n* M3 is trained on a subset of 1,000 rows (D3), which may contain some repeated rows from D1 and D2\n* M4 is trained on a subset of 1,000 rows (D4), which may contain some repeated rows from D1, D2, and D3\n\nWhen a new test data is passed to the system, each model produces an output. The outputs are then combined using majority voting.\n\n### Majority Voting\n\nIf the outputs of the models are:\n\n* M1: 0\n* M2: 1\n* M3: 1\n* M4: 1\n\nThe final output will be 1, since three models have predicted 1 and only one model has predicted 0.\n\n### Advantages\n\n* **Improved Accuracy**: Bagging can improve the accuracy of the system by reducing overfitting and increasing the robustness
