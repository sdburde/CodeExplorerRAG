Here are some of the things that can be done based on the provided code:\n\n1. **Activate and Deactivate**: The `activate` and `deactivate` methods can be used to control the activation and deactivation of the Ripple Effect.\n2. **Set Active**: The `setActive` method can be used to set the active state of the Ripple Effect.\n3. **Compute Dimensions**: The `computeDimensions` method can be used to compute the dimensions of the Ripple Effect.\n4. **Compute Indicator Client Rect**: The `computeIndicatorClientRect` method can be used to compute the client rectangle of the indicator.\n5. **Focus and Blur**: The `focus` and `blur` methods can be used to handle focus and blur events.\n6. **Handle Click**: The `handleClick` method can be used to handle click events.\n7. **Handle Ripple Events**: The `handleRippleMouseDown`, `handleRippleTouchStart`, `handleRippleDeactivate`, `handleRippleMouseEnter`, `handleRippleMouseLeave`, `handleRippleFocus`, and `handleRippleBlur` methods can be used to handle various ripple-related events.\n\nPlease note that this is not an exhaustive list, and the actual functionality may be more extensive based on the complete implementation of the MDC component.",

      "content": "Here's a simple React application to get you started. This example includes a counter that increments and decrements when you click the buttons.\n\n```jsx\n// index.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);\n\n  const handleIncrement = () => {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  };\n\n  const handleDecrement = () => {\n    setCount(count - 1);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>\n      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>\n      <button onClick={handleDecrement}>Decrement</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <Counter />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n```\n\nHowever, if you're using a bundler like `create-react-app`, you should structure your code like this:\n\n```jsx\n// src/index.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n```\n\n```jsx\n// src/App.js\nimport React from 'react';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);\n\n  const handleIncrement = () => {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  };\n\n  const handleDecrement = () => {\n    setCount(count - 1);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>\n      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>\n      <button onClick={handleDecrement}>Decrement</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n```css\n/* src/index.css */\nbody {\n  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n```\n\nTo run this code, you'll need to install Node.js and npm (the package manager for Node.js) if you haven't already. Then, you can create a new React app using `create-react-app`:\n\n```bash\nnpx create-react-app my-app\ncd my-app\n```\n\nNow, you can replace the files in `src` with the code above.\n\nTo run your app, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis will start a development server, and you can view your app in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\nIf you're using a bundler like Webpack or Rollup, you'll need to configure it to bundle your code and serve it. This is usually done using a configuration file, such as `webpack.config.js` or `rollup.config.js`.",
