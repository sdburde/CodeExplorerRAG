      "content": "This script is used to build a Docker image and run a command inside the container to bundle a JavaScript file. Let's break it down into smaller parts:\n\n**1. `set -e`**\n\nThis line is not actually part of the Docker build process. `set -e` is a bash command that causes the script to exit immediately if any command returns a non-zero exit status. This is useful for debugging and ensuring that the script stops running if anything goes wrong.\n\n**2. `IMAGE_NAME=esbuild`**\n\nThis line sets an environment variable named `IMAGE_NAME` to the value `esbuild`. This variable will be used to name the Docker image.\n\n**3. `docker build --tag=$IMAGE_NAME - << EOF`**\n\nThis line starts the Docker build process. Here's what it does:\n\n- `docker build`: This command builds a Docker image.\n- `--tag=$IMAGE_NAME`: This option assigns the name `esbuild` to the image.\n- `-`: This tells Docker to build the image from the standard input (the `<< EOF` part).\n- `<< EOF`: This is a bash command that starts a here document, which allows us to pass a block of text to the `docker build` command.\n\n**4. `FROM node:lts-alpine`**\n\nThis line tells Docker to base the new image on the `node:lts-alpine` image. This means that the new image will inherit all the packages and configurations from the `node:lts-alpine` image.\n\n- `node`: This is the base image for a Node.js application.\n- `lts`: This stands for \"long-term support,\" which means that this image is based on a stable version of Node.js.\n- `alpine`: This is a lightweight Linux distribution that is used to create the base image.\n\n**5. `WORKDIR /root`**\n\nThis line sets the working directory in the Docker image to `/root`. This means that when we run commands inside the container, they will be run from this directory.\n\n**6. `RUN npm install esbuild`**\n\nThis line installs the `esbuild` package using npm (Node Package Manager). This package is a popular JavaScript bundler.\n\n**7. `RUN npm install...` (repeated several times)**\n\nThese lines install various other packages using npm, including:\n\n- `react-dom`: A package for rendering React components to the DOM.\n- `@msgpack/msgpack`: A package for working with MessagePack, a binary serialization format.\n- `@material/mwc-...`: A set of packages for Material Design components, including drawers, top app bars, icon buttons, and more.\n- `ag-grid-community`: A package for creating grid tables.\n- `ag-charts-community`: A package for creating charts.\n- `@material/mwc-textfield` and `@material/mwc-slider`: Packages for text fields and sliders, respectively.\n\n**8. `docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/root/src --workdir=/root/src $IMAGE_NAME ...`**\n\nThis line runs a command inside a container based on the `esbuild` image. Here's what it does:\n\n- `docker run`: This command runs a container from an image.\n- `--rm`: This option tells Docker to automatically remove the container when it exits.\n- `-it`: This option allows us to interact with the container using a terminal.\n- `-v $PWD:/root/src`: This option mounts the current directory (`$PWD`) to the `/root/src` directory inside the container.\n- `--workdir=/root/src`: This option sets the working directory inside the container to `/root/src`.\n- `$IMAGE_NAME`: This is the name of the image to run.\n- `...`: This is the command to run inside the container.\n\n**9. `/root/node_modules/esbuild/bin/esbuild src/script.jsx ...`**\n\nThis is the command that is run inside the container. It uses the `esbuild` package to bundle a JavaScript file. Here's what it does:\n\n- `/root/node_modules/esbuild/bin/esbuild`: This is the path to the `esbuild` executable.\n- `src/script.jsx`: This is the JavaScript file to bundle.\n- `--bundle`: This option tells `esbuild` to bundle the file.\n- `--sourcemap`: This option tells `esbuild` to generate a source map.\n- `--legal-comments=none`: This option tells `esbuild` to remove comments from the output.\n- `--watch`: This option tells `esbuild` to watch for changes to the input file and re-bundle automatically.\n- `--outfile=script.min.js`: This option specifies the output file name.\n\nOverall, this script is used to build a Docker image that includes various packages, including `esbuild`, and then runs a command inside the container to bundle a JavaScript file.",
